##In this assigment, a dashboard was made in [scdata.ai] (scdata.ai) GCPS and following was analyzed:

1: Business GeoInfo – Regional Analysis
- Learned how to assess and compare regions based on economic vitality, industry presence, and employment dynamics.
- Chose **Finland** as the target region for its innovation-driven economy and quality of life.
- Used **GDP contribution, industry concentration, and business growth rate** as key factors.

2: Industry Analysis – Sector Comparison
- Compared industries across three dimensions:
  - **Profitability** (e.g., operating margins),
  - **Growth potential** (industry revenue trends),
  - **Financial Risk** (liability/assets).
- Benchmarked against the "Industrials" sector.
- Selected a high-potential industry based on financial health and future outlook.

3: Enterprise Diagnosis – Company-Level Evaluation
- Evaluated companies within the chosen industry using:
  - **Operating Margin vs Revenue** (profit frontier),
  - **Return on Assets (ROA)** (efficiency),
  - **Liability-to-Asset Ratio** (risk).
- Identified top-performing companies in different revenue classes.
- Gained experience interpreting scatter plots and financial metrics.
