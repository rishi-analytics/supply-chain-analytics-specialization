# üìä Module 3: Competition Positioning

This module explores how to assess a company‚Äôs position in the competitive landscape using data-driven analysis. It focuses on ranking firms relative to peers and identifying performance patterns through KPI benchmarking.

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

- Position a company within its industry to evaluate its competitive standing  
- Rank companies against their peers to identify strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas  
- Examine KPIs to detect abnormal performance signals

## üîç Key Concepts and Examples

### üß© 1. Competitive Landscape Mapping

Understanding the size and profitability of firms helps reveal their market position. For example, in the airline industry:

- **Delta Air Lines (DAL)**, **United Airlines (UAL)**, and **American Airlines (AAL)** were similar in size based on revenue.  
- However, **Delta** and **United** showed higher operating income than **American**, indicating they were more profitable.  
- **Southwest Airlines (LUV)**, though smaller in size, had better profitability due to efficient asset utilization.

This shows that size and profitability do not always align, and a smaller company can outperform a larger one operationally.

---

### üìà 2. Profit Frontier

The **profit frontier** represents the best achievable profitability level for a given revenue class. It acts like a boundary that defines optimal performance.

- **Delta Airlines** was positioned on the profit frontier, showing it achieved the best possible margin for its revenue level.  
- **American Airlines**, on the other hand, was far below the frontier, making it the worst performer in its revenue group.

**Think of it like a running race**. The profit frontier is the track record, and companies on or near it are top performers. Those far behind signal underperformance and room for improvement.

---

### üìä 3. Return vs. Risk Matrix

This analysis plots **Return on Assets (ROA)** against the **Liability to Asset ratio**, helping assess how well a company converts its resources into profit while managing financial risk.

- **Southwest Airlines** had the **highest ROA** and **lowest liability ratio**, reflecting strong performance and financial stability.  
- **American Airlines** had a **liability-asset ratio greater than 1**, meaning it had more liabilities than assets. It also had the **lowest ROA**, showing weak returns and high financial stress.

**In simple terms**, if you are borrowing too much (high liabilities) but not making enough return (low ROA), your business is operating under financial strain.

---

### ü•á 4. Enterprise Ranking

Enterprise ranking uses KPIs such as **total revenue**, **operating income**, and **ROA** to classify companies within an industry. These rankings help detect which firms lead and which lag behind.

- **Delta** ranked highest in both **total revenue** and **operating income** among US airlines.  
- **Southwest**, despite lower revenue, ranked highest in **ROA**, reflecting better profitability per dollar of asset.  
- A mistake often made is assuming that bigger companies are always better. For example, **JD.com** had higher revenue but was less profitable than **Alibaba**.

**The key lesson is**: ranking by multiple KPIs gives a more complete picture than just looking at revenue alone.

---

### ü©∫ 5. KPI Examination (Health Check Approach)

**KPI examination** is similar to a **physical health check-up**. Just as doctors assess your health using vital signs and reference ranges, business analysts evaluate a company using financial metrics and industry percentiles.

- In medicine, a **red blood cell (RBC)** count between the **5th and 95th percentile** is considered normal.  
- In business, a company‚Äôs KPI (such as net income margin or current ratio) is considered healthy if it falls between the **25th and 75th percentile** compared to peers.

#### Example: American Airlines KPI Health Check

- **Profitability**: Lowest operating margin, net margin, and ROA in the industry (almost 0 percentile rank).  
- **Financial Health**: Current ratio at 45 percent and liability-asset ratio above one, suggesting inability to meet short-term debts.  
- **Growth**: Normal total revenue growth, but operating and net income were below the 25th percentile.  
- **Efficiency**: Acceptable operating cost over total revenue, but high inventory days indicated mixed operational efficiency.

This examination process identifies specific problems and helps guide targeted improvements.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaway

Competitive positioning is not just about being big. It is about being **efficient**, **profitable**, and **financially healthy** compared to others in the same industry. Methods like **profit frontier mapping**, **risk-return analysis**, **ranking**, and **KPI benchmarking** give a clear, multi-dimensional view of how a company is really performing.

| Q4       | Combining Enterprise Rankings        | Revenue shows size but not profit; Big ‚â† Strong; Profitability/ROA matters more than size                               |
| Q5       | KPI Examination                      | Shows percentile rank; Identifies normal/high/low KPI range; Provides reference intervals                               |

## üìå Project Summary

This project focuses on the **competitive positioning** and **KPI examination** of **DoorDash**, with a contextual link to **Wolt** (a Finnish company now owned by DoorDash) and the broader food delivery industry. While my original focus was on Finland and Wolt, due to data availability, I pivoted to analyzing DoorDash through U.S. market data on SCData.

Key findings include:
- Strong revenue and gross profit performance
- Persistently negative net income due to high operational costs
- High growth rate in free cash flow and revenue
- Mixed financial health, with solid liquidity but higher liabilities

This helped understand DoorDash's position among its peers and the trade-offs between growth and profitability in capital-intensive sectors.

## üß† Interpretation & Examples

To make KPI Examination more relatable:

- Just like **a doctor compares your lab test results (e.g., RBC count)** against a reference range (say 5th‚Äì95th percentile), here we compare DoorDash's metrics against industry benchmarks.
  
- Example: DoorDash‚Äôs **Gross Margin (46.8%)** is better than the median (36%) and falls between the **75th and 90th percentiles**, meaning it‚Äôs performing better than most competitors in this area.

- On the flip side, a KPI like **Operating Margin (-6.7%)** falls below the 50th percentile ‚Äî suggesting operational inefficiencies or high fixed costs.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

- **Strengths**: DoorDash is a top performer in **revenue growth** and **cash flow generation**, with a solid **gross margin** and **low debt levels**.
- **Weaknesses**: It still struggles with **profitability ratios** such as operating and net margin, and has **moderate efficiency issues** in return-based KPIs.
- **Opportunity**: Leveraging strong growth and cash flow to streamline operations and improve long-term profitability.
