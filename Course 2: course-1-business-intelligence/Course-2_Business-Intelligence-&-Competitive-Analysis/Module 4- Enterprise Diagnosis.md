## Module 4: Enterprise Diagnosis

### üîç Overview
Enterprise diagnosis involves benchmarking companies to uncover strengths, weaknesses, and root causes of performance issues. It includes trend analysis, value driver identification, and financial breakdowns.

---

### üìä Case Study: American Airlines

- Compared to Delta and United, American Airlines had similar revenue but lower profitability (net margin, return on assets).
- 2015‚Äì2019 trends showed declining operating income and a rising liability-asset ratio.
- Weak investor returns and negative equity reflected poor financial health.
- Summary: Large in size but weak in profitability due to high liabilities and low margins.

---

### üìà Strengths & Weaknesses Analysis

- This analysis is similar to a **SWOT analysis** but is supported by detailed quantitative data (some eg., profitability, growth, financial health, and operational efficiency).
- Includes both point-in-time **comparison** and **trend** analysis.
- Key questions: Is the company improving or declining? Surpassing or lagging competitors?

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Value Driver Analysis

- Focuses on controllable internal factors affecting performance.
- Varies by industry:
  - In asset-heavy sectors: high liability-asset ratio reduces return on assets.
  - In retail: low gross margins may pair with high revenue growth.
  - High inventory turnover reduces costs in inventory-intensive sectors.
- Example: TSM outperformed Intel due to better **operational efficiency**, not technology.
- Analysts must distinguish **correlation from causation** using data + industry insight.

---

### ü©∫ Breakdown Analysis

- Like a **doctor diagnosing by anatomy**, this dissects financials to find root issues:
  - Revenue breakdown reveals cost structure.
  - Asset breakdown shows liabilities, equity, and liquidity health.
- Example: American Airlines had high operating costs, low cash reserves, and tax-driven income spikes‚Äîsigns of unsustainability.

---

### üïµÔ∏è Competitive Intelligence

- Like a **detective**, analysts monitor competitors to spot problems or opportunities.
- Example: A **bakery** notices no one offers gluten-free options‚Äîrevealing a market gap.
- Three levels of analysis:
  1. **Industry** ‚Äì trends, risks, competition
  2. **Positioning** ‚Äì where the company stands
  3. **Diagnosis** ‚Äì strengths, weaknesses, and breakdown analysis

### Mini Project Overview: Enterprise Diagnosis of Food Delivery Companies

This project presents a comparative financial analysis of two major global food delivery companies ‚Äî **DoorDash** (USA) and **Swiggy** (India) ‚Äî to understand their business models, market dynamics, and performance indicators using publicly accessible data.

Key insights include:

- **DoorDash** demonstrates significantly higher revenue and a strong trajectory toward profitability, driven by large-scale operations and cost management improvements.
- **Swiggy** shows steady revenue growth but remains loss-making, reflecting challenges in scaling profitably in emerging markets.
- Both companies follow high-expense, growth-focused models typical of tech-driven food delivery platforms.
- Finnish market context, represented by sector averages, suggests that local players like **Wolt** may operate with more efficient cost structures, leading to better operational sustainability.
- The analysis highlights that revenue growth alone does not guarantee profitability; operational efficiency and cost control are critical value drivers.

This diagnosis helps project how DoorDash‚Äôs recent merger with Wolt might leverage efficiencies to succeed in Finland‚Äôs competitive food delivery landscape.
