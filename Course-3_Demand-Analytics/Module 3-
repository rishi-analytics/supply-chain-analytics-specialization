# 🧪 Quiz Summary – Residuals & Model Assumptions

### ✅ What is a residual?

A **residual** is the difference between an actual observed value and the predicted value from the model — in other words, it’s the **error**:
\[
\text{Residual} = Y_{\text{actual}} - Y_{\text{predicted}}
\]

Residuals help us understand what our model **misses** and how reliable it is.

### ✅ Causes of residuals

- **Random noise**: unpredictable factors (e.g., weather, accidents, one-off events)
- **Omitted variables**: important predictors missing from the model
- **Wrong model form**: using a linear model when a nonlinear one fits better

### ✅ Diagnosing Model Conditions with Residuals

| Condition               | When It’s Met                                        | Quiz Insight |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **Linearity**          | Residuals are randomly scattered (white noise)      | ✔️           |
| **Independence**       | Residuals aren't correlated over time               | ⚠️ (missed)  |
| **Equal Variance (Homoscedasticity)** | Residuals have constant variance           | ✔️           |

📌 **Reflection:** One question was missed due to not selecting **all** correct options on independence — a reminder to check for **multiple correct answers** in future quizzes!
